### 1. Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To run the code successfully, make sure we have these libraries installed in our Python environment:
- python 3.6+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pickle

### 2. Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This is the third project from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) "Data Science Nanodegree Program" that contains different recommender systems that suggest articles to new and returning users. These systems use real data from the IBM Watson Studio platform to offer personalized article recommendations. By exploring the code and resources, we can learn about the implementation of these recommendation algorithms and gain insights into how article recommendations work.

### 3. Results <a name="results"></a>
You can look results and explore more from here:
1. `Recommendations_with_IBM.html`
2. `Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb`

### 4. Acknowledgements <a name="acknow"></a>
- Thanks to [IBM Watson Studio](https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-studio) platform for providing the dataset.
- Also [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) which granted access to this dataset.
